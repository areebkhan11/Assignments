            <h1>Hi, I’m Grace Chuang.</h1> 
            <p>I’m a mix of all things antidisciplinary: a storyteller, 
                designer, engineer, biologist, and photographer. I’m
                 passionate about creating experiences that bring attention
                  to the mystery, wonder, and beauty of the in-betweens.
                   As a core member of the Creative Team at <b>Ginkgo Bioworks</b>,
                    I bring the story of synthetic biology to life through creative 
                    collaborations, and help visualize a world where we design with 
                    nature to grow products. I'm also a founding editor and the art 
                    director of <b>Grow by Ginkgo</b>, a long-form illustrated magazine produced 
                    with <b>Massive Science</b>.</p>
                    <p>
                I received a B.S. in Chemical Engineering summa cum laude from Cornell 
                University, where I spent my time coaxing mammalian cells, teaching 
                design on iGEM, exploring biology with architects, producing films, 
                and photographing stories of love, heartbreak, triumph, and failure.
                 It’s there, with a pipette in one hand and a camera in the other, 
                 where I discovered a deep yearning to create with purpose and meaning,
                  in the mess and the complexity. I’ve been carving my own path at the
                   intersection of things ever since.</p>
